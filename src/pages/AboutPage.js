    <h1>About IAWA</h1>
    <h2>Our History</h2>
    <p>
      The International Archive of Women in Architecture (IAWA) was established
      in 1985 as a joint program of the College of Architecture and Urban
      Studies and the University Libraries at Virginia Tech. The purpose of the
      Archive is to document the history of women's contributions to the built
      environment by collecting, preserving, and providing access to the records
      of women's architectural organizations and the professional papers of
      women architects, landscape architects, designers, architectural
      historians and critics, and urban planners.
    </p>
    <p>
      The IAWA collections have always been open to scholars, students, and
      public researchers around the world. Historically, this meant traveling to
      Virginia Tech and visiting the University Libraries’ Special Collections
      Department to see materials in person. Through this website, today’s
      researchers also have access to a growing library of digitized documents
      and visual materials from the IAWA collections. This project was made
      possible in part by funding from the Council on Library and Information
      Resources (CLIR) through its "Digitizing Hidden Collections" program.
    </p>
    <h2>What We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      Today, the IAWA documents the legacies of more than 435 individuals,
      firms, organizations, and exhibits from the 1890s through the present day.
      The permanent collections include approximately 2000 cubic feet of
      documents, photographs and negatives, architectural drawings, sketches,
      scrapbooks, building models, presentation boards, and other materials that
      capture the creative process. The IAWA also collects books, biographical
      information, and other published materials as part of its mission to act
      as a clearinghouse of information about the global history of women in
      architecture.
