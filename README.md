# DLP Access Website
A Multi-Tenant Serverless Website built with GraphQL, React, AWS Amplify, AWS AppSync, DynamoDB, and ElasticSearch.

We have a [Live Demo](https://vtdlp-demo.cloud.lib.vt.edu/) site! We also have several University Libraries sites. [International Archive of Women in Architecture (IAWA)](https://iawa.lib.vt.edu/) is one of them.

## Schema
This application utilizes two DynamoDB tables:
* Collection table stores collection information. A ```Collection``` type that presents a group of archives (digital asset or digital object).
* Archive table stores digital object information. A ```Archive``` type that presents a digital asset or digital object.
* Each type has many properties, see [Data Models](docs/data_model.md)

## Techniques
* AppSync: We use AppSync to handle the communication with backend DynamoDB and ElasiticSearch. Please see the initial [examples](docs/appsync.md). This [file](src/graphql/queries.js) elaborates all the operations currently in use.
* DynamoDB: We use DynamoDB tables to store all the metadata.
* ElasticSearch: We use ElasticSearch to enable full-text and faceted search.
* IIIF Images: We use [aws-batch-iiif-generator](https://github.com/vt-digital-libraries-platform/aws-batch-iiif-generator) to generate IIIF tiles and manifest in AWS.

## Launching the app
[![amplifybutton](https://oneclick.amplifyapp.com/button.svg)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home#/deploy?repo=https://github.com/VTUL/dlp-access)

### Deploy the app using AWS CLI
* Create a branch with a backend environment
```
aws amplify create-branch --app-id=AmplifyAppId --branch-name=GitHubBranchName --backend-environment-arn=BackendEnvARN
```
* Deploy the app
```
aws amplify start-job --app-id=AmplifyAppId --branch-name=GitHubBranchName --job-type=RELEASE
```
* Get Backend Environment Arn
```
aws amplify list-backend-environments --app-id=AmplifyAppId
```

### Run locally with the Amplify CLI
0. Prerequisites
  ```sh
  npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli
  brew install yarn
  ```

1. Clone the repo

  ```sh
  git clone git@github.com:VTUL/dlp-access.git
  ```

2. Change into the directory & install dependencies

  ```sh
  cd dlp-access
  npm install
  ```

3. Initialize the Amplify backend

  ```sh
  amplify init
  ```

4. Push the application into your account

  ```sh
  amplify push
  ```

## Amplify Environment variables
We assign each site with a unique ```REACT_APP_REP_TYPE```.

As an example, the site of [IAWA](https://iawa.lib.vt.edu/) takes these settings below:
```
REACT_APP_REP_TYPE=IAWA
```

You can see various examples in the [VTDLP-siteconfig](https://github.com/VTUL/VTDLP-siteconfig).

## Site custom images and HTML files
We put custom static images (e.g., site cover image) and HTML files (e.g, about page) in a S3 bucket with Cloudfront setup.

You can see various examples in the [VTDLP-sitecontent](https://github.com/VTUL/VTDLP-sitecontent).

## Running the tests
* An end-to-end testing framework using [Cypress.io](https://www.cypress.io/) has been setup for this project.

* To test locally

  0. Put your configuration json files to a S3 bucket and enable CORS and make the config file public. 
  1. Start local server using ```REACT_APP_REP_TYPE=IAWA npm start```
  2. Launch the Cypress app ```CYPRESS_password=secret yarn run cypress open```

## Cleanup
If you'd like to tear down the project & delete all of the resources created by this project, you can run the following:
```sh
amplify delete
```
